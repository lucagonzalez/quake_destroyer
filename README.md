# Quake Destroyer

### 2022 Nasa Spaceapps Challenge


We created a data analysis tool that takes information from the USGS Earthquake Catalog and we display it intuitively on a map  on the phone. The app shows earthquakes and all the details  about them, taking the user straight to the USGS website.

The app also helps the user understand the scale of an earthquake by challenging the user to shake the phone and see how that movement would translate as an earthquake. It also compares the user's result with real earthquake data
